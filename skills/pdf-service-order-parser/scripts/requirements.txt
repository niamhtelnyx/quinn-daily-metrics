# PDF Processing Dependencies (install as needed)
# The script will try multiple methods and use whichever is available

# Option 1: pdfplumber (recommended - good balance of features and reliability)
pdfplumber>=0.6.0

# Option 2: PyMuPDF (fast, good for complex layouts)
# PyMuPDF>=1.20.0

# Option 3: pdfminer (fallback option)
# pdfminer.six>=20220319

# Note: pdftotext (poppler-utils) is tried first but requires system installation:
# macOS: brew install poppler
# Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
