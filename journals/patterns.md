# Behavioral Patterns

*Recurring patterns in task execution, successes, failures, and improvement opportunities.*

## Positive Patterns
- **Documentation First:** Writing insights immediately while context is fresh leads to better retention
- **Structured Reflection:** Using consistent templates helps capture more complete learnings
- **Functional Specialization:** Creating domain-specific agents with clear missions vs general-purpose assistance

## Negative Patterns  
- **[To be discovered through supervisor analysis]**

## Emerging Patterns
- **Meta-Learning Loop:** The act of documenting learning seems to enhance the learning itself
- **Context Preservation:** Structured journals help maintain continuity across sessions better than memory files alone
- **Personality-Driven Design:** Agents with distinct personalities (Prophet, Quarterback) create clearer delegation boundaries

## Pattern Analysis Notes
*Supervisor agents will identify and document patterns here based on journal analysis.*
