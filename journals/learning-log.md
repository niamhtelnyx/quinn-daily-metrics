## Learning Entries

## 2026-02-05 - Meta-Learning System Implementation
**Discovery:** Structured journaling + supervisor agents can create continuous improvement cycles
**Application:** After every task, document reflections immediately while context is fresh. Use spawned agents to review and synthesize learnings periodically.
**Related:** Memory management, heartbeat optimization, sub-agent protocols
**Confidence:** Medium - theoretical understanding, needs practical testing

## 2026-02-05 - Task Documentation Importance  
**Discovery:** Writing down lessons immediately prevents knowledge loss between sessions
**Application:** Always update journals/ before ending significant work. Don't rely on "mental notes"
**Related:** Memory persistence, session continuity, workspace organization
**Confidence:** High - proven pattern from existing memory system

## 2026-02-05 - Agent Specialization Strategy
**Discovery:** Functional specialization with clear domains (Prophet, Quarterback, etc.) is more effective than general-purpose agents
**Application:** Create role-specific agents with distinct personalities and focused missions rather than trying to do everything in one agent
**Related:** Sub-agent spawning, delegation strategies, organizational efficiency
**Confidence:** Medium - based on COO's successful blueprint, but need to test implementation

## 2026-02-05 - Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns
**Discovery:** Agent skill sharing requires three layers: shared skills directory + session communication + shared state management
**Application:** Use shared-skills/ for common capabilities, sessions_send for real-time coordination, shared-state/ for persistent findings exchange
**Related:** Agent collaboration, knowledge inheritance, coordination protocols
**Confidence:** Medium - logical architecture design, needs practical testing
