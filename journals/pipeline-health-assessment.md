| **0: AE Qualification** | 10 | $123K | $12,300 | 🟡 **C+** |

## 🚨 CRITICAL PIPELINE HEALTH FINDINGS

### 1. **VELOCITY CRISIS: 134 Aged Deals ($2.42M)**
- **22% of qualified pipeline** has no activity in 30+ days
- **$2.42M in stalled opportunities** = dead revenue velocity
- **Stage 2 concentration risk:** 43% of pipeline stuck in proposal phase

### 2. **Q1 2026 FORECASTING PRESSURE**
- **180 deals closing this quarter:** $2.5M pipeline
- **Average Q1 deal size:** $13,911 (smaller deals closing faster)
- **Q1 represents only 27% of total pipeline** → forecasting confidence issues

### 3. **DEAL CONCENTRATION ANALYSIS**
- **21 large deals (>$50K):** $3.26M = 36% of total pipeline
- **High concentration risk:** Top 2% of deals drive 1/3 of revenue
- **Large deal average:** $155K (11x overall average)

### 4. **STAGE PROGRESSION BOTTLENECKS**
- **Stage 2 overflow:** 320 deals (30% of pipeline) stuck in proposal
- **Product Blocked:** 60 deals = operational inefficiency signal  
- **Testing stage efficiency:** Best $/deal ratio but only 82 deals
