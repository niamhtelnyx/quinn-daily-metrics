## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### **CAUSE #1: QUALIFICATION CRITERIA MISALIGNMENT**

**Quinn AI Model Issues:**
- **61.2% rejection rate** suggests Quinn's qualification criteria don't match AE standards
- **Voice AI priority missing:** Quinn not optimized for high-value Voice AI prospect identification
- **Scale validation gaps:** No business size or revenue potential assessment

**Evidence:** Quinn identifies prospects AEs consistently reject as unqualified

### **CAUSE #2: LOW-INTENT SOURCE OVERLOAD**

**Marketing "Contact Sales" Problem:**
- **Generic inquiry handling:** "Contact Sales" captures price-shopping, not qualified buyers
- **No pre-qualification:** Direct routing without qualification filters
- **Volume overwhelm:** 1,706 handoffs with 53.8% rejection = wasted AE time

### **CAUSE #3: ATTRIBUTION DATA LOSS**

**Lead Source Tracking Crisis:**
- **98.4% NULL lead sources** on opportunities (discovered earlier)
- **No optimization feedback:** Cannot identify which handoff sources convert to closed deals
- **Blind optimization:** No data on which sources produce revenue vs just opportunities

### **CAUSE #4: PROCESS AUTOMATION GAPS**

**Manual Qualification Bottlenecks:**
- **No automated scoring:** Every handoff requires manual AE review
- **Inconsistent standards:** Different AEs apply different qualification criteria
- **No Voice AI priority:** High-value prospects not fast-tracked
